Carlos Deleon developing a program, utilizing various methods and tools.

Part 1: Initially, I engaged Bing AI/Chat to assist in coding the print loop for CSV files. Subsequently, I manually coded the process of breaking each line into a split array list, which held an array of strings for each line of the CSV. This was done to generate the parameters needed, eventually printing out the results. Although time-consuming, this approach proved effective.

Part 2: I sought help from ChatGPT to design certain buttons and layout elements using JavaFX. I found success with the implementation, utilizing TreeSet, although I contemplated potential changes depending on rank or seniority. Despite encountering challenges, particularly with the if-else buttons within the GUI map, I managed to resolve them. Although there are still existing bugs to address, the functionality related to managing days and changing colors for availability marks a promising beginning.

Part 3: While considering a potential switch from TreeSet to TreeMap, I worked on fixing numerous if-else conditions but acknowledge the presence of lingering bugs. I found Scene Builder to be a significant improvement for designing interfaces, expressing satisfaction with its usability.

Part 4: With ongoing efforts to refine parsing mechanisms and revamp the second GUI, I aim to implement serializable features and manual assignment functionalities. I assure that the program now functions correctly, successfully loading and generating data while accurately displaying each person's schedule.
