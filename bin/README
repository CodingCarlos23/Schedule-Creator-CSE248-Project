How I made the program?

part 1
I asked Bing AI/Chat to code the print loop for csv files
then i manually coded i broke each line into split array list, holding a array of strings for each line of the csv
then i used that to make the paramaters and then printed out took long time but it work
csv file is soooo bad XD but we make it work
wasted more time on Ai then actually just coding it myself

part 2
i asked chatgpt to make some of the buttons / java fx layout worked pretty well i used treeset but might have to change that later depending on rank/seniorty
for now it works i also struggled with making the if else buttons for the gui in the map it is a lot espically for how teidous the data is but i got it done
there are still lots of bugs i need to account for but ill fix the if and else later. important thing is the days do work and change color for avability so it is a good start

part 2 again
yeah treeset might switch to treemap later but depend. fixed a lot of if and else but still some bugs
also using scene builder much better imo very good and nice

re working the parsing and remaking my 2nd gui and going to work on serializable
and manual assign and recommendation

This should be working all correctly now
